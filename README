This is PGP::Mail. It is provided under the GPL or Artistic Licence
at your preference. It was written as a solution to a problem that
really ought to have a module on the CPAN, however, when I looked,
I couldn't find one. There are umpteen better ways to write it, but
most of them seemed to involve sub-classing large parts of
MIME::Parser which I didn't want to have to do. In essence, the point
is that for the moment, it is BALGE (By And Large, Good Enough). If
you want to take it as a base, please feel free, if you want to send
me patches, ditto.

Consider it Alpha-quality software, however, but Alpha quality that
works well enough for the simple job it currently does. See the
perldoc for more information.
